I am self taught Java Developer. i can tell you the path as i learn all these through books and coding at my personal laptop.

Step 1: Core Java Fundamentals and Understanding of OOConcepts and Exception handling and some Internals of Java.

Step 2: Learn JDBC.

Step 2 : Learn JSP/Servlet/HTML/JavaScript and build CRUD Web App with MVC Pattern and (JDBC++ connection pooling). try to apply your full Object Oriented Principle knowledge on this App.

Step 3: Learn Hibernate and wrote persistent (dao layer) logic with Hibernate in the same app.

Step 4: Just read about Spring and study why we need this…. IOC/Decoupling/Cross Cutting Concerns/Pooling/Exceptions/Template.

Step 4.1 : Just Think the difference if same app you build with Spring and what benefits you can have. Did Existing app some problem because you did not used Spring concept like IOC/Template/Support Classes etc..

Step 5: Start writing a new App with Spring MVC/Hibernate. Build That test that.

Step 6: Learn JEE concept like WebService / Messaging / Transactions /Cache and try to implement with Spring and without Spring.

Congratulations You are JavaEE Developer.

Thanks For Reading.

Happy Learning!
-----------------------------------------------
In my personal experience, one should follow learning these stacks by making same project again and again in combination as :

    Servlets + JDBC
    JSP + JDBC
    Spring(XML) + JDBC
    Spring(XML) + Hibernate
    Spring(annotations) + Hibernate
    Spring(annotations) + Hibernate (+JPA)
    Spring Boot + Hibernate (+JPA)

This should be the order in my point of view for very solid understanding.
